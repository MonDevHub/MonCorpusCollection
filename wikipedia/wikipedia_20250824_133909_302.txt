[၆၀][၆၁] Geological activity is still taking place on Mars.
The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200 Mya.
Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20 Mya,
indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions.
[၆၂] On 19 February 2008,
images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed evidence of an avalanche from a 700-မဳတာ-high (2,
300 ft) cliff.
[၆၃] The Phoenix lander returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium,
sodium,
potassium and chlorine.
These nutrients are found in soils on Earth,
and they are necessary for growth of plants.
[၆၄] Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.
and contains 0.
6% of the salt perchlorate.
[၆၅][၆၆][၆၇][၆၈] This is a very high concentration and makes the Martian soil toxic (see also Martian soil toxicity).
[၆၉][၇၀] Streaks are common across Mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters,
troughs,
and valleys.
The streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age.
The streaks can start in a tiny area,
then spread out for hundreds of metres.
They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path.
The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils.
[၇၁] Several other explanations have been put forward,
including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.

[၈၁] The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on 31 July 2008.
[၈၂] Landforms visible on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet's surface.
Huge linear swathes of scoured ground,
known as outflow channels,
cut across the surface in about 25 places.
These are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers,
though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava.
[၈၃][၈၄] One of the larger examples,
Ma'adim Vallis is 700 kiloမဳတာs (430 mi) long,
much greater than the Grand Canyon,
with a width of 20 kiloမဳတာs (12 mi) and a depth of 2 kiloမဳတာs (1.
2 mi) in places.
It is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in Mars's history.
[၈၅] The youngest of these channels are thought to have formed as recently as only a few million years ago.
[၈၆] Elsewhere,
particularly on the oldest areas of the Martian surface,
finer-scale,
dendritic networks of valleys are spread across significant proportions of the landscape.
Features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by runoff resulting from precipitation in early Mars history.
Subsurface water flow and groundwater sapping may play important subsidiary roles in some networks,
but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases.
[၈၇] Along crater and canyon walls,
there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies.
The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the Southern Hemisphere and to face the Equator;
all are poleward of 30° latitude.
A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water,
probably from melting ice,
[၈၈][၈၉] although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust.
[၉၀][၉၁] No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed,
indicating that these are young features,
possibly still active.
[၈၉] Other geological features,
such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters,
are further evidence for warmer,
wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history.
[၉၂] Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across a large proportion of the surface,
for which there is independent mineralogical,
sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.
[၉၃] Further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and goethite,
both of which sometimes form in the presence of water.
[၉၆] In 2004,
Opportunity detected the mineral jarosite.
This forms only in the presence of acidic water,
which demonstrates that water once existed on Mars.
[၉၇] More recent evidence for liquid water comes from the finding of the mineral gypsum on the surface by NASA's Mars rover Opportunity in December 2011.
[၉၈][၉၉] It is estimated that the amount of water in the upper mantle of Mars,
represented by hydroxyl ions contained within the minerals of Mars's geology,
is equal to or greater than that of Earth at 50 300 parts per million of water,
which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 200 1,
000 မဳတာs (660 3,
280 ft).
[၁၀၀] In 2005,
radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles[၇၉] and at mid-latitudes.
[၈၁][၁၀၁] The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007.
The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on 31 July 2008.
[၈၂] On 18 March 2013,
NASA reported evidence from instruments on the Curiosity rover of mineral hydration,
likely hydrated calcium sulfate,
in several rock samples including the broken fragments of "Tintina" rock and "Sutton Inlier" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like "Knorr" rock and "Wernicke" rock.
[၁၀၂][၁၀၃][၁၀၄] Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water,
amounting to as much as 4% water content,
down to a depth of 60 centiမဳတာs (24 in),
during the rover's traverse from the Bradbury Landing site to the Yellowknife Bay area in the Glenelg terrain.
[၁၀၂] In September 2015,
NASA announced that they had found conclusive evidence of hydrated brine flows on recurring slope lineae,
based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes.
[၁၀၅][၁၀၆][၁၀၇] These observations provided confirmation of earlier hypotheses based on timing of formation and their rate of growth,
that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing in the very shallow subsurface.
[၁၀၈] The streaks contain hydrated salts,
perchlorates,
which have water molecules in their crystal structure.
[၁၀၉] The streaks flow downhill in Martian summer,
when the temperature is above 23° Celsius,
and freeze at lower temperatures.
[၁၁၀] Researchers suspect that much of the low northern plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep,
though this remains controversial.
[၁၁၁] In March 2015,
scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean.
This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth.
The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth,
suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water.
Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater,
though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean.
Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed,
and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.
[၁၁၂] Near the northern polar cap is the 81.
4 kiloမဳတာs (50.
6 mi) wide Korolev Crater,
where the Mars Express orbiter found it to be filled with approximately 2,
200 kiloကုဗမဳတာs (530 cu mi) of water ice.
[၁၁၃] The crater floor lies about 2 kiloမဳတာs (1.
2 mi) below the rim,
and is covered by a 1.
8 kiloမဳတာs (1.
1 mi) deep central mound of permanent water ice,
up to 60 kiloမဳတာs (37 mi) in diameter.
[၁၁၃][၁၁၄] In February 2020,
it was found that dark streaks called recurring slope lineae (RSL),
which appear seasonably,
are caused by briny water flowing for a few days annually.
[၁၁၅][၁၁၆] Mars has two permanent polar ice caps.
During a pole's winter,
it lies in continuous darkness,
chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25 30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice).
[၁၁၈] When the poles are again exposed to sunlight,
the frozen CO2 sublimes.
These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor,
giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds.
Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the Opportunity rover in 2004.
[၁၁၉] The caps at both poles consist primarily (70%) of water ice.
Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only,
whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick.
This permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by flat floored,
shallow,
roughly circular pits,
which repeat imaging shows are expanding by meters per year;
this suggests that the permanent CO2 cover over the south pole water ice is degrading over time.
[၁၂၀] The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1,
000 kiloမဳတာs (620 mi) during the northern Mars summer,
[၁၂၁] and contains about 1.
6 million kiloကုဗမဳတာs (5.
7×1016 cu ft) of ice,
which,
if spread evenly on the cap,
would be 2 kiloမဳတာs (1.
2 mi) thick.
[၁၂၂] (This compares to a volume of 2.
85 million kiloကုဗမဳတာs (1.
01×1017 cu ft) for the Greenland ice sheet.
) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 kiloမဳတာs (220 mi) and a thickness of 3 kiloမဳတာs (1.
9 mi).
[၁၂၃] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.
6 million cubic km.
[၁၂၄] Both polar caps show spiral troughs,
which recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis Effect.
[၁၂၅][၁၂၆] The seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground.
With the arrival of spring,
sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab,
elevating and ultimately rupturing it.
This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust.
This process is rapid,
observed happening in the space of a few days,
weeks or months,
a rate of change rather unusual in geology especially for Mars.
The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice,
the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.
[၁၂၇][၁၂၈][၁၂၉][၁၃၀] Although better remembered for mapping the Moon,
Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer were the first areographers.
They began by establishing that most of Mars's surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet's rotation period.
In 1840,
Mädler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars.
Rather than giving names to the various markings,
Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters;
Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was thus feature "a.
"[၁၃၁] Today,
features on Mars are named from a variety of sources.
Albedo features are named for classical mythology.
Craters larger than 60 km are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of Mars.
Craters smaller than 60 km are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than 100,
Large valleys are named for the word "Mars" or "star" in various languages;
small valleys are named for rivers.
[၁၃၂] Large albedo features retain many of the older names,
but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features.
For example,
Nix Olympica (the snows of Olympus) has become Olympus Mons (Mount Olympus).
[၁၃၃] The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas,
with differing albedo.
The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian "continents" and given names like Arabia Terra (land of Arabia) or Amazonis Planitia (Amazonian plain).
The dark features were thought to be seas,
hence their names Mare Erythraeum,
Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus.
The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum.
[၁၃၄] The permanent northern polar ice cap is named Planum Boreum,
whereas the southern cap is called Planum Australe.
Mars's equator is defined by its rotation,
but the location of its Prime Meridian was specified,
as was Earth's (at Greenwich),
by choice of an arbitrary point;
Mädler and Beer selected a line for their first maps of Mars in 1830.
After the spacecraft Mariner 9 provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972,
a small crater (later called Airy-0),
located in the Sinus Meridiani ("Middle Bay" or "Meridian Bay"),
was chosen by Merton Davies of the Rand Corporation[၁၃၅] for the definition of 0.
0° longitude to coincide with the original selection.
[၁၃၆] For mapping purposes,
the United States Geological Survey divides the surface of Mars into thirty cartographic quadrangles,
each named for a classical albedo feature it contains.
The quadrangles can be seen and explored via the interactive image map below.
The dichotomy of Martian topography is striking:
northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands,
pitted and cratered by ancient impacts.
Research in 2008 has presented evidence regarding a theory proposed in 1980 postulating that,
four billion years ago,
the Northern Hemisphere of Mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of Earth's Moon.
If validated,
this would make the Northern Hemisphere of Mars the site of an impact crater 10,
600 by 8,
500 kiloမဳတာs (6,
600 by 5,
300 mi) in size,
or roughly the area of Europe,
Asia,
and Australia combined,
surpassing the South Pole Aitken basin as the largest impact crater in the Solar System.
[၅၅][၅၆] Mars is scarred by a number of impact craters:
a total of 43,
000 craters with a diameter of 5 kiloမဳတာs (3.
1 mi) or greater have been found.
[၁၄၂] The largest confirmed of these is the Hellas impact basin,
a light albedo feature clearly visible from Earth.
[၁၄၃] Due to the smaller mass and size of Mars,
the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth.
Mars is located closer to the asteroid belt,
so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source.
Mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets,
those that lie within the orbit of Jupiter.
[၁၄၄] In spite of this,
there are far fewer craters on Mars compared with the Moon,
because the atmosphere of Mars provides protection against small meteors and surface modifying processes have erased some craters.
Martian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted.
[၁၄၅] The shield volcano Olympus Mons (Mount Olympus) is an extinct volcano in the vast upland region Tharsis,
which contains several other large volcanoes.
Olympus Mons is roughly three times the height of Mount Everest,
which in comparison stands at just over 8.
8 kiloမဳတာs (5.
5 mi).
[၁၄၆] It is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the Solar System,
depending on how it is measured,
with various sources giving figures ranging from about 21 to 27 kiloမဳတာs (13 to 17 mi) high.
[၁၄၇][၁၄၈] The large canyon,
Valles Marineris (Latin for "Mariner Valleys",
also known as Agathadaemon in the old canal maps),
has a length of 4,
000 kiloမဳတာs (2,
500 mi) and a depth of up to 7 kiloမဳတာs (4.
3 mi).
The length of Valles Marineris is equivalent to the length of Europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of Mars.
By comparison,
the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 446 kiloမဳတာs (277 mi) long and nearly 2 kiloမဳတာs (1.
2 mi) deep.
Valles Marineris was formed due to the swelling of the Tharsis area,
which caused the crust in the area of Valles Marineris to collapse.
In 2012,
it was proposed that Valles Marineris is not just a graben,
but a plate boundary where 150 kiloမဳတာs (93 mi) of transverse motion has occurred,
making Mars a planet with possibly a two-tectonic plate arrangement.
[၁၄၉][၁၅၀] Images from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) aboard NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter have revealed seven possible cave entrances on the flanks of the volcano Arsia Mons.
[၁၅၁] The caves,
named after loved ones of their discoverers,
are collectively known as the "seven sisters.
"[၁၅၂] Cave entrances measure from 100 to 252 မဳတာs (328 to 827 ft) wide and they are estimated to be at least 73 to 96 မဳတာs (240 to 315 ft) deep.
Because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves,
it is possible that they extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface.
"Dena" is the only exception;
its floor is visible and was measured to be 130 မဳတာs (430 ft) deep.
The interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids,
UV radiation,
solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet's surface.
[၁၅၃] Mars lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago,
[၁၅၄] possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes,
[၁၅၅] so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere,
lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer.
Both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars,
[၁၅၄][၁၅၆] and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter.
Compared to Earth,
the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied.
Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30 Pa (0.
0044 psi) on Olympus Mons to over 1,
155 Pa (0.
1675 psi) in Hellas Planitia,
with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600 Pa (0.
087 psi).
[၁၅၇] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found 35 kiloမဳတာs (22 mi)[၁၅၈] above Earth's surface.
The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.
6% of that of Earth 101.
3 kPa (14.
69 psi).
The scale height of the atmosphere is about 10.
8 kiloမဳတာs (6.
7 mi),
[၁၅၉] which is higher than Earth's,
6 kiloမဳတာs (3.
7 mi),
because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's,
an effect offset by both the lower temperature and 50% higher average molecular weight of the atmosphere of Mars.
The atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide,
93% argon and 1.
89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water.
[၁၀][၁၆၀] The atmosphere is quite dusty,
containing particulates about 1.
5 µm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface.
[၁၆၁] It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it.
[၁၇] Methane has been detected in the Martian atmosphere;
[၁၆၂][၁၆၃] it occurs in extended plumes,
and the profiles imply that the methane is released from discrete regions.
The concentration of methane fluctuates from about 0.
24 ppb during the northern winter to about 0.
65 ppb during the summer.
[၁၆၄] Estimates of its lifetime range from 0.
6 to 4 years,
[၁၆၅][၁၆၆] so its presence indicates that an active source of the gas must be present.
Methane could be produced by non-biological process such as serpentinization involving water,
carbon dioxide,
and the mineral olivine,
which is known to be common on Mars.
[၁၆၇] Methanogenic microbial life forms in the subsurface are among possible sources.
But even if rover missions determine that microscopic Martian life is the source of the methane,
the life forms likely reside far below the surface,
outside of the rover's reach.
[၁၆၈] In 1994,
the European Space Agency's Mars Express found an ultraviolet glow coming from "magnetic umbrellas" in the Southern Hemisphere.
Mars does not have a global magnetic field which guides charged particles entering the atmosphere.
Mars has multiple umbrella-shaped magnetic fields mainly in the Southern Hemisphere,
which are remnants of a global field that decayed billions of years ago.
In late December 2014,
NASA's MAVEN spacecraft detected evidence of widespread auroras in Mars's Northern Hemisphere and descended to approximately 20 30° North latitude of Mars's equator.
The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere,
creating auroras below 100 km above the surface,
Earth's auroras range from 100 km to 500 km above the surface.
Magnetic fields in the solar wind drape over Mars,
into the atmosphere,
and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere,
causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.
[၁၇၀] On 18 March 2015,
NASA reported the detection of an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of Mars.
[၁၇၁] In September 2017,
NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled,
and were associated with an aurora 25 times brighter than any observed earlier,
due to a massive,
and unexpected,
solar storm in the middle of the month.
[၁၇၂] Of all the planets in the Solar System,
the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like,
due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes.
The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long.
Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about 143 °C ( 225 °F) at the winter polar caps[၁၃] to highs of up to 35 °C (95 °F) in equatorial summer.
[၁၄] The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat,
the low atmospheric pressure,
and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil.
[၁၇၃] The planet is 1.
52 times as far from the Sun as Earth,
resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.
[၁၇၄] If Mars had an Earth-like orbit,
its seasons would be similar to Earth's because its axial tilt is similar to Earth's.
The comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect.
Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere and winter in the north,
and near aphelion when it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere and summer in the north.
As a result,
the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case.
The summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to 30 °C (54 °F).
[၁၇၅] Mars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System,
reaching speeds of over 160 km/h (100 mph).
These can vary from a storm over a small area,
to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet.
They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun,
and have been shown to increase the global temperature.
[၁၇၆] Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million km (143 million mi),
and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days.
The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day:
24 hours,
39 minutes,
and 35.
244 seconds.
[၁၇၈] A Martian year is equal to 1.
8809 Earth years,
or 1 year,
320 days,
and 18.
2 hours.
[၁၀] The axial tilt of Mars is 25.
19° relative to its orbital plane,
which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth.
[၁၀] As a result,
Mars has seasons like Earth,
though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer.
In the present day epoch,
the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.
[၁၅] Mars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.
of the seven other planets in the Solar System,
only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity.
It is known that in the past,
Mars has had a much more circular orbit.
At one point,
35 million Earth years ago,
Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.
much less than that of Earth today.
[၁၇၉] Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,
000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,
000 years.
[၁၈၀] Mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity,
with a period of 2.
2 million Earth years,
and this overshadows the 96,
000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs.
[clarification needed] For the last 35,
000 years,
the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets.
The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,
000 years.
[၁၈၁] The current understanding of planetary habitability the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life favors planets that have liquid water on their surface.
Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone,
which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars.
[၁၈၂] During perihelion,
Mars dips inside this region,
but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods.
The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability.
Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.
[၁၈၃] The lack of a magnetosphere and the extremely thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge:
the planet has little heat transfer across its surface,
poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state).
Mars is nearly,
or perhaps totally,
geologically dead;
the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.
[၁၈၅] In situ investigations have been performed on Mars by the Viking landers,
Spirit and Opportunity rovers,
Phoenix lander,
and Curiosity rover.
Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today,
but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown.
The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results,
including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients.
This sign of life was later disputed by scientists,
resulting in a continuing debate,
with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life.
A re-analysis of the Viking data,
in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life,
has suggested that the Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life.
The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form.
[၁၈၆] Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has an alkaline pH and it contains magnesium,
sodium,
potassium and chloride.
[၁၈၇] The soil nutrients may be able to support life,
but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.
[၁၈၈] A recent analysis of martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.
6 ppm ClO 4,
4 ppm ClO 3,
and 16 ppm NO 3,
most likely of Martian origin.
The ClO 3 suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines,
such as ClO 2 or ClO,
produced both by UV oxidation of Cl and X-ray radiolysis of ClO 4.
Thus,
only highly refractory and/or well-protected (sub-surface) organics or life forms are likely to survive.
[၁၈၉] A 2014 analysis of the Phoenix WCL showed that the Ca(ClO4)2 in the Phoenix soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form,
perhaps for as long as 600 million years.
If it had,
the highly soluble Ca(ClO4)2 in contact with liquid water would have formed only CaSO4.
This suggests a severely arid environment,
with minimal or no liquid water interaction.
[၁၉၁] Scientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001,
which is thought to have originated from Mars,
could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago.
This proposal has been met with skepticism,
and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.
[၁၉၂] Small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life,
as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.
[၁၉၃][၁၉၄] Alternatively,
these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means,
such as serpentinite.
[၁၆၇] Impact glass,
formed by the impact of meteors,
which on Earth can preserve signs of life,
has been found on the surface of the impact craters on Mars.
[၁၉၅][၁၉၆] Likewise,
the glass in impact craters on Mars could have preserved signs of life if life existed at the site.
[၁၉၇][၁၉၈][၁၉၉] In May 2017,
evidence of the earliest known life on land on Earth may have been found in 3.
48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia.
These findings may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.
[၂၀၀][၂၀၁] In early 2018,
media reports speculated that certain rock features at a site called Jura looked like a type of fossil,
but project scientists say the formations likely resulted from a geological process at the bottom of an ancient drying lakebed,
and are related to mineral veins in the area similar to gypsum crystals.
[၁၉၀] On 7 June 2018,
NASA announced that the Curiosity rover had discovered organic compounds in sedimentary rocks dating to three billion years old,
[၂၀၂] indicating that some of the building blocks for life were present.
[၂၀၃][၂၀၄] In July 2018,
scientists reported the discovery of a subglacial lake on Mars,
the first known stable body of water on the planet.
It sits 1.
5 km (0.
9 mi) below the surface at the base of the southern polar ice cap and is about 20 kiloမဳတာs (12 mi) wide.
[၂၀၅][၂၀၆] The lake was discovered using the MARSIS radar on board the Mars Express orbiter,
and the profiles were collected between May 2012 and December 2015.
[၂၀၇] The lake is centered at 193° East,
81° South,
a flat area that does not exhibit any peculiar topographic characteristics.
It is mostly surrounded by higher ground except on its eastern side,
where there is a depression.
[၂၀၅] Mars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons,
Phobos (about 22 kiloမဳတာs (14 mi) in diameter) and Deimos (about 12 kiloမဳတာs (7.
5 mi) in diameter),
which orbit close to the planet.
Asteroid capture is a long-favored theory,
but their origin remains uncertain.
[၂၀၈] Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall;
they are named after the characters Phobos (panic/fear) and Deimos (terror/dread),
in Greek mythology,
accompanied their father Ares,
god of war,
into battle.
Mars was the Roman counterpart of Ares.
[၂၀၉][၂၁၀] In modern Greek,
the planet retains its ancient name Ares (Aris:
Άρης).
[၂၁၁] From the surface of Mars,
the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear different from that of the Moon.
Phobos rises in the west,
sets in the east,
and rises again in just 11 hours.
Deimos,
being only just outside synchronous orbit where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation rises as expected in the east but slowly.
Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos,
7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer,
as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.
[၂၁၂] Because the orbit of Phobos is below synchronous altitude,
the tidal forces from the planet Mars are gradually lowering its orbit.
In about 50 million years,
it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.
[၂၁၂] The origin of the two moons is not well understood.
Their low albedo and carbonaceous chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids,
supporting the capture theory.
The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture.
But both have circular orbits,
near the equator,
which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex.
Accretion early in the history of Mars is plausible,
but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself,
if that is confirmed.
A third possibility is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption.
[၂၁၃] More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior,
[၂၁၄] and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars,
[၂၁၅] point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,
[၂၁၆] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.
Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids,
the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.
[၂၁၅] Mars may have moons smaller than 50 to 100 မဳတာs (160 to 330 ft) in diameter,
and a dust ring is predicted to exist between Phobos and Deimos.
[၂၁၇] Dozens of crewless spacecraft,
including orbiters,
landers,
and rovers,
have been sent to Mars by the Soviet Union,
the United States,
Europe,
and India to study the planet's surface,
climate,
and geology.
As of 2021[update],
Mars is host to eleven functioning spacecraft:
eight in orbit 2001 Mars Odyssey,
Mars Express,
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,
MAVEN,
Mars Orbiter Mission,
ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter,
Emirates Mars Mission and Tianwen-1 and three on the surface the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover,
the InSight lander and the Perseverance rover.
The public can request images of Mars via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'ဂမၠိုင် HiWish program.
The Mars Science Laboratory,
named Curiosity,
launched on 26 November 2011,
and reached Mars on 6 August 2012 UTC.
It is larger and more advanced than the Mars Exploration Rovers,
with a movement rate up to 90 မဳတာs (300 ft) per hour.
[၂၁၈] Experiments include a laser chemical sampler that can deduce the make-up of rocks at a distance of 7 မဳတာs (23 ft).
[၂၁၉] On 10 February 2013,
the Curiosity rover obtained the first deep rock samples ever taken from another planetary body,
using its on-board drill.
[၂၂၀] The same year,
it discovered that Mars's soil contains between 1.
5% and 3% water by mass (albeit attached to other compounds and thus not freely accessible).
[၂၂၁] Observations by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had previously revealed the possibility of flowing water during the warmest months on Mars.
[၂၂၂] On 24 September 2014,
Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM),
launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),
reached Mars orbit.
ISRO launched MOM on 5 November 2013,
with the aim of analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography.
The Mars Orbiter Mission used a Hohmann transfer orbit to escape Earth's gravitational influence and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to Mars.
The mission is the first successful Asian interplanetary mission.
[၂၂၃] The European Space Agency,
in collaboration with Roscosmos,
launched the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander on 14 March 2016.
[၂၂၄] While the Trace Gas Orbiter successfully entered Mars orbit on 19 October 2016,
Schiaparelli crashed during its landing attempt.
[၂၂၅] In May 2018,
NASA's InSight lander was launched,
along with the twin MarCO CubeSats that flew by Mars and acted as telemetry relays during the landing.
The mission arrived at Mars in November 2018.
[၂၂၆][၂၂၇] InSight detected potential seismic activity (a "marsquake") in April 2019.
[၂၂၈][၂၂၉] In 2019,
MAVEN spacecraft mapped high-altitude global wind patterns at Mars for the first time.
[၂၃၀][၂၃၁] It was discovered that the winds which are miles above the surface retained information about the land forms below.
[၂၃၀] NASA launched the Mars 2020 mission on 30 July 2020.
[၂၃၂] The rover Perseverance successfully landed on the surface of Mars on 18 February 2021.
The mission will cache samples for future retrieval and return of them to Earth.
The current concept for the Mars sample-return mission would launch in 2026 and feature hardware built by NASA and ESA.
[၂၃၃] The European Space Agency will launch the ExoMars rover and surface platform sometime between August and October 2022.
[၂၃၄] The United Arab Emirates' Mars Hope orbiter was launched on 19 July 2020,
and successfully entered orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021.
[၂၃၅] The probe will conduct a global study of the Martian atmosphere.
[၂၃၆] With this accomplishment,
UAE became the second country,
after India,
to reach Mars on its first attempt.
Several plans for a human mission to Mars have been proposed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries,
but no human mission has yet launched.
SpaceX founder Elon Musk presented a plan in September 2016 to,
optimistically,
launch a crewed mission to Mars in 2024 at an estimated development cost of US$10 billion,
but this mission is not expected to take place before 2027.
[၂၃၇] In October 2016,
President Barack Obama renewed United States policy to pursue the goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s,
and to continue using the International Space Station as a technology incubator in that pursuit.
[၂၃၈][၂၃၉] The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.
[၂၄၀] Script error:
The module returned a nil value.
It is supposed to return an export table.
With the presence of various orbiters,
landers,
and rovers,
it is possible to practice astronomy from Mars.
Although Mars's moon Phobos appears about one-third the angular diameter of the full moon on Earth,
Deimos appears more or less star-like,
looking only slightly brighter than Venus does from Earth.
[၂၄၁] Various phenomena seen from Earth have also been observed from Mars,
such as meteors and auroras.
[၂၄၂] The apparent sizes of the moons Phobos and Deimos are sufficiently smaller than that of the Sun;
thus,
their partial "eclipses" of the Sun are best considered transits (see transit of Deimos and Phobos from Mars).
[၂၄၃][၂၄၄] Transits of Mercury and Venus have been observed from Mars.
A transit of Earth will be seen from Mars on 10 November 2084.
[၂၄၅] On 19 October 2014,
comet Siding Spring passed extremely close to Mars,
so close that the coma may have enveloped Mars.
[၂၄၆][၂၄၇][၂၄၈][၂၄၉][၂၅၀][၂၅၁] The mean apparent magnitude of Mars is +0.
71 with a standard deviation of 1.
[၁၂] Because the orbit of Mars is eccentric,
the magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from about 3.
0 to 1.
[၂၅၃] The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.
86 when the planet is in conjunction with the Sun.
[၁၂] At its brightest,
Mars (along with Jupiter) is second only to Venus in luminosity.
[၁၂] Mars usually appears distinctly yellow,
orange,
or red.
NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown,
mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand.
[၂၅၄] When farthest away from Earth,
it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest.
When least favorably positioned,
it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time.
At its most favorable times at 15-year or 17-year intervals,
and always between late July and late September a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope.
Especially noticeable,
even at low magnification,
are the polar ice caps.
[၂၅၅] As Mars approaches opposition,
it begins a period of retrograde motion,
which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping motion with respect to the background stars.
The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days,
and Mars reaches its peak luminosity in the middle of this motion.
[၂၅၆] The point at which Mars's geocentric longitude is 180° different from the Sun's is known as opposition,
which is near the time of closest approach to Earth.
The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.
5 days away from the closest approach.
The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and 103 million km (34 and 64 million mi) due to the planets' elliptical orbits,
which causes comparable variation in angular size.
[၂၅၇][၂၅၈] The last Mars opposition occurred on 27 July 2018,
[၂၅၉] at a distance of about 58 million km (36 million mi).
[၂၆၀] The next Mars opposition occurs on 13 October 2020,
at a distance of about 63 million km (39 million mi).
[၂၆၀] The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars,
its synodic period,
is 780 days;
but the number of days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.
[၂၆၁] As Mars approaches opposition it begins a period of retrograde motion,
which makes it appear to move backwards in a looping motion relative to the background stars.
The duration of this retrograde motion is about 72 days.
Mars made its closest approach to Earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,
000 years,
006 km (0.
37271925 AU;
419 mi),
magnitude 2.
on 27 August 2003,
at 09:
13 UTC.
This occurred when Mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its perihelion,
making it particularly easy to see from Earth.
The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on 12 September 57,
617 BC,
the next time being in 2287.
[၂၆၂] This record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches.
For instance,
the minimum distance on 22 August 1924,
was 0.
37285 AU,
and the minimum distance on 24 August 2208,
will be 0.
37279 AU.
[၁၈၀] Every 15 to 17 years,
Mars comes into opposition near its perihelion.
These perihelic oppositions make a closer approach to earth than other oppositions which occur every 2.
1 years.
Mars comes into perihelic opposition in 2003,
2018 and 2035,
with 2020 and 2033 being close to perihelic opposition.
The history of observations of Mars is marked by the oppositions of Mars,
when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible,
which occur every couple of years.
Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars,
which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion,
making it even closer to Earth.
The ancient Sumerians believed that Mars was Nergal,
the god of war and plague.
[၂၆၄] During Sumerian times,
Nergal was a minor deity of little significance,
[၂၆၄] but,
during later times,
his main cult center was the city of Nineveh.
[၂၆၄] In Mesopotamian texts,
Mars is referred to as the "star of judgement of the fate of the dead.
"[၂၆၅] The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by the ancient Egyptian astronomers and,
by 1534 BCE,
they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet.
[၂၆၆] By the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire,
the Babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations of their behavior.
For Mars,
they knew that the planet made 37 synodic periods,
or 42 circuits of the zodiac,
every 79 years.
They invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets.
[၂၆၇][၂၆၈] In Ancient Greece,
the planet was known as ဂရိတြေံ:
Πυρόεις.
[၂၆၉] In the fourth century BCE,
Aristotle noted that Mars disappeared behind the Moon during an occultation,
indicating that the planet was farther away.
[၂၇၀] Ptolemy,
a Greek living in Alexandria,
[၂၇၁] attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars.
Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest,
which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.
[၂၇၂] Literature from ancient China confirms that Mars was known by Chinese astronomers by no later than the fourth century BCE.
[၂၇၃] In the East Asian cultures,
Mars is traditionally referred to as the "fire star" (Chinese:
based on the Five elements.
[၂၇၄][၂၇၅][၂၇၆] During the seventeenth century,
Tycho Brahe measured the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet.
[၂၇၇] When the telescope became available,
the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance.
This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672.
The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments.
[၂၇၈] The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of 13 October 1590,
seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg.
[၂၇၉] In 1610,
Mars was viewed by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei,
who was first to see it via telescope.
[၂၆၃] The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.
[၂၈၀] By the 19th century,
the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified.
A perihelic opposition of Mars occurred on 5 September 1877.
In that year,
the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli used a 22 centiမဳတာs (8.
7 in) telescope in Milan to help produce the first detailed map of Mars.
These maps notably contained features he called canali,
which were later shown to be an optical illusion.
These canali were supposedly long,
straight lines on the surface of Mars,
to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth.
His term,
which means "channels" or "grooves",
was popularly mistranslated in English as "canals.
"[၂၈၁][၂၈၂] Influenced by the observations,
the orientalist Percival Lowell founded an observatory which had 30 and 45 centiမဳတာs (12 and 18 in) telescopes.
The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions.
He published several books on Mars and life on the planet,
which had a great influence on the public.
[၂၈၃][၂၈၄] The canali were independently found by other astronomers,
like Henri Joseph Perrotin and Louis Thollon in Nice,
using one of the largest telescopes of that time.
[၂၈၅][၂၈၆] The seasonal changes (consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during Martian summer) in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on Mars,
and it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation.
The telescope never reached the resolution required to give proof to any speculations.
As bigger telescopes were used,
fewer long,
straight canali were observed.
During an observation in 1909 by Camille Flammarion with an 84 centiမဳတာs (33 in) telescope,
irregular patterns were observed,
but no canali were seen.
[၂၈၇] Even in the 1960s,
articles were published on Martian biology,
putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars.
Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published.
[၂၈၈] Once spacecraft visited the planet during NASA's Mariner missions in the 1960s and 1970s,
these concepts were radically broken.
The results of the Viking life-detection experiments aided an intermission in which the hypothesis of a hostile,
dead planet was generally accepted.
[၂၈၉] Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be made using the data from these missions,
and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission,
launched in 1996 and operated until late 2006,
that allowed complete,
extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography,
magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained.
[၂၉၀] These maps are available online;
for example,
at Google Mars.
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments,
and supporting lander missions.
NASA provides two online tools:
Mars Trek,
which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration,
and Experience Curiosity,
which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.
[၂၉၁] Mars is named after the Roman god of war.
In different cultures,
Mars represents masculinity and youth.
Its symbol,
a circle with an arrow pointing out to the upper right,
is used as a symbol for the male gender.
The many failures in Mars exploration probes resulted in a satirical counter-culture blaming the failures on an Earth-Mars "Bermuda Triangle",
a "Mars Curse",
or a "Great Galactic Ghoul" that feeds on Martian spacecraft.
[၂၉၂] The fashionable idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians exploded in the late 19th century.
Schiaparelli's "canali" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying,
cooling,
dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works.
[၂၉၃] Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed "Mars Fever.
"[၂၉၄] In 1899,
while investigating atmospheric radio noise using his receivers in his Colorado Springs lab,
inventor Nikola Tesla observed repetitive signals that he later surmised might have been radio communications coming from another planet,
possibly Mars.
In a 1901 interview,
Tesla said:
It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control.
Although I could not decipher their meaning,
it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental.
The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.
[၂၉၅] Tesla's theories gained support from Lord Kelvin who,
while visiting the United States in 1902,
was reported to have said that he thought Tesla had picked up Martian signals being sent to the United States.
[၂၉၆] Kelvin "emphatically" denied this report shortly before leaving:
"What I really said was that the inhabitants of Mars,
if there are any,
were doubtless able to see New York,
particularly the glare of the electricity.
"[၂၉၇] In a New York Times article in 1901,
Edward Charles Pickering,
director of the Harvard College Observatory,
said that they had received a telegram from Lowell Observatory in Arizona that seemed to confirm that Mars was trying to communicate with Earth.
[၂၉၈] Early in December 1900,
we received from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that a shaft of light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes.
I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country.
The observer there is a careful,
reliable man and there is no reason to doubt that the light existed.
It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars.
That was all.
Now the story has gone the world over.
In Europe,
it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars,
and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up.
Whatever the light was,
we have no means of knowing.
Whether it had intelligence or not,
no one can say.
It is absolutely inexplicable.
[၂၉၈] Pickering later proposed creating a set of mirrors in Texas,
intended to signal Martians.
[၂၉၉] In recent decades,
the high-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars,
culminating in Mars Global Surveyor,
revealed no artifacts of habitation by "intelligent" life,
but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars continues from commentators such as Richard C.
Hoagland.
Reminiscent of the canali controversy,
these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images,
such as "pyramids" and the "Face on Mars.
" Planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote:
Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.
[၂၈၂] The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life.
[၃၀၀] Thus originated a large number of science fiction scenarios,
among which is H.
Wells' The War of the Worlds,
published in 1898,
in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth.
Influential works included Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles,
in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization,
Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series,
Lewis' novel Out of the Silent Planet (1938),
[၃၀၁] and a number of Robert A.
Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.
[၃၀၂] A comic figure of an intelligent Martian,
Marvin the Martian,
appeared in Haredevil Hare (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers,
and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.
[၃၀၄] After the Mariner and Viking spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is,
an apparently lifeless and canal-less world,
these ideas about Mars had to be abandoned,
and a vogue for accurate,
realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed,
the best known of which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy.
Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction,
especially in film.
[၃၀၅]
