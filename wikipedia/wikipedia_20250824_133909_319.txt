Thanks you Unicode is a standard that defines how text should be saved into data and how it is read and written.
Almost every script in the world,
including Burmese,
is defined in the Unicode Standard.
Carefully designed by experts of the field around the world,
this international standard is supported by virtually all the latest platforms--not only in major operating systems like Windows,
and Linux but also in OSes of mobile phones and many electronic devices.
The Unicode Standard is the most well-known encoding scheme to support the largest number of scripts/languages in a single page of code.
More information is available at Unicode.
See discussion on Unicode usage in Wikipedia.
All Wikipedias,
including the English language Wikipedia,
use Unicode as it is Wikimedia Foundation policy.
The following table shows the differences in language support between Zawgyi-One and Unicode fonts.
Zawgyi-One and other pseudo-Unicode fonts require nearly twice as many characters as Unicode fonts to support just one language:
Burmese.
Unlike Zawgyi-One and other pseudo-Unicode fonts,
Unicode fonts use intelligent rendering to stack consonants and combine diacritics.
Although Zawgyi is currently the most widely used solution for input in Myanmar-language websites,
it is not Unicode-compliant and does not meet the standards set by the Unicode Standard (nor does it meet the W3C standards,
which define the standards for the World Wide Web).
Also,
there are multiple ways of storing text,
which makes search challenging.
However,
for those who use Zawgyi and would like to contribute to the Myanmar Wikipedia,
several converters (Zawgyi Unicode 5.
1) are available below:
An online typewriter that supports Zawgyi as well as Unicode fonts is available at Burglish System tester These are links for fonts that conform to the Burmese script encoded in Unicode 5.
