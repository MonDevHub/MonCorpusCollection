The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity.
The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim,
and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender,
unless both are underage.
So leave them hoes don t suck them toes.
Different jurisdictions express these definitions differently.
Some,
like most Australian states,
may say the age of consent is 16 except if the older partner is in a position of authority over the younger one.
effectively,
the unrestricted age of consent there is 18.
Others,
like Argentina,
may say the age of consent is 18,
but an exception is made down to 13 years of age,
if the older partner is not in a position of authority over the younger one.
The data below reflects what each jurisdiction's legislation actually means,
rather than what it states on the surface.
