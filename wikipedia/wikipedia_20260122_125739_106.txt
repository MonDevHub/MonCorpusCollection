There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an

interplate earthquake

: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of

dip

and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.

The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in

Alaska (1957)

,

Chile (1960)

, and

Sumatra (2004)

, all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the

San Andreas Fault

(

1857

,

1906

), the

North Anatolian Fault

in Turkey (

1939

), and the

Denali Fault

in Alaska (

2002

), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.

Normal faults

Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being

extended

such as a

divergent boundary

. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about 6 kiloမဳတာs (3.7 mi)

*

.

Reverse faults

Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being

shortened

such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along

convergent plate boundaries

, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes,

megathrust earthquakes

, including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.

Strike-slip faults

Strike-slip faults

are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental

transforms

, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.

Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible.

Carrizo Plain

, northwest of Los Angeles

In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.

This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that "pushes" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (

greatest

principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass "escapes" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the

least

principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.

Energy released

For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in

World War II

.

This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures

and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.

Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can become 50 100 km (31 62 mi) (

Japan, 2011

;

Alaska, 1964

), making the most powerful earthquakes possible.

Shallow-focus and deep-focus earthquakes

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Depth of focus (tectonics)

Collapsed Gran Hotel building in the

San Salvador

metropolis, after the shallow

1986 San Salvador earthquake

The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the ring of fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as "shallow-focus" earthquakes, while those with a focal-depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed "mid-focus" or "intermediate-depth" earthquakes. In

Subduction

zones, where older and colder

oceanic crust

descends beneath another tectonic plate,

deep-focus earthquakes

may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).

These seismically active areas of subduction are known as

Wadati Benioff zones

. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted

lithosphere

should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by

olivine

undergoing a

phase transition

into a

spinel

structure.

Earthquakes and volcanic activity

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Volcano tectonic earthquake

Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by

tectonic

faults and the movement of

magma

in

volcanoes

. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the

1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens

.

Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by

seismometers

and

tiltmeters

(a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.

Rupture dynamics

A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the

brittle-ductile transition zone

and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.

In most cases the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the

shear wave

(S-wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this:

Supershear earthquakes

Supershear earthquake

ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the

2001 Kunlun earthquake

has been attributed to the effects of the

sonic boom

developed in such earthquakes.

Slow earthquakes

Slow earthquake

ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the

tsunami earthquake

, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the

1896 Sanriku earthquake

.

Co-seismic overpressuring and effect of pore pressure

During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane so increasing pore pressure consequently to vaporization of the ground water already contained within rock.

In the coseismic phase, such increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed and, furthermore, in the post-seismic phase it can control the

Aftershock

sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.

From the point of view of the

Mohr-Coulomb strength theory

, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect.
As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow which increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.

Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may

induce seismicity

.

Earthquake clusters

Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.

Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.

Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long term research study is being conducted around the

Parkfield earthquake

cluster.

Aftershocks

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Aftershock

Magnitude of the

Central Italy earthquakes of August

and

October 2016

and

January 2017

and the aftershocks (which continued to occur after the period shown here)

An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,

along with the crust around the ruptured

fault plane

as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.

An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.

If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the originalmain shock is redesignated as a

foreshock

. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced

fault plane

adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.

Earthquake swarms

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Earthquake swarm

Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of

aftershocks

by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, so none has a notable higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at

Yellowstone National Park

.

In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook

Southern California

's

Imperial Valley

, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.

Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an

earthquake storm

, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or

stress redistribution

of the previous earthquakes. Similar to

aftershocks

but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the

North Anatolian Fault

in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.

Intensity and magnitude of earthquakes

Shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on distance from the earthquake and underlying rock or soil makeup.

The

first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes

was developed by

Charles F. Richter

in 1935. Subsequent scales (see

seismic magnitude scales

) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.

Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as "Richter magnitude" or "Richter scale", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the

moment magnitude

scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake.

Frequency of occurrence

The

Messina earthquake

and tsunami took as many as 200,000 lives on December 28, 1908, in

Sicily

and

Calabria

.

It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.

Minor earthquakes occur nearly constantly around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the

Azores

in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal and Japan.

Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being

exponential

; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur in a particular time period than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.

In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are:

an earthquake of 3.7 4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7 5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.

This is an example of the

Gutenberg Richter law

.

The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The

United States Geological Survey

(USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0 7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.

In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.

More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.

A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.

Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kiloမဳတာ-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the

Pacific Ring of Fire

, which for the most part bounds the

Pacific Plate

.

Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the

Himalayan Mountains

.

With the rapid growth of

mega-cities

such as Mexico City, Tokyo and Tehran in areas of high

seismic risk

, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.

Induced seismicity

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Induced seismicity

While most earthquakes are caused by movement of the Earth's

tectonic plates

, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or

fracking

.

Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude

2011 Oklahoma earthquake

is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into

injection wells

,

and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.

A

Columbia University

paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude

2008 Sichuan earthquake

was induced by loading from the

Zipingpu Dam

,

though the link has not been conclusively proved.

Seismic magnitude scales

ကေုာံ

Seismology

The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the

Richter magnitude scale

in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century.

Seismic waves

travel through the

Earth's interior

and can be recorded by

seismometers

at great distances. The

surface wave magnitude

was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The

moment magnitude scale

not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the

seismic moment

(total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The

Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale

, the

Medvedev Sponheuer Karnik scale

, and the

Mercalli intensity scale

are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.

Seismic waves

Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:

Longitudinal

P-waves

(shock- or pressure waves)

Transverse

S-waves

(both body waves)

Surface waves

 (

Rayleigh

and

Love

waves)

Speed of seismic waves

Propagation velocity

of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the

density

and

elasticity

of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the

epicenter

to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the

hypocenter

can be computed roughly.

P-wave speed

Upper crust soils and unconsolidated sediments: 2 3 km (1.2 1.9 mi) per second

Upper crust solid rock: 3 6 km (1.9 3.7 mi) per second

Lower crust: 6 7 km (3.7 4.3 mi) per second

Deep mantle: 13 km (8.1 mi) per second.

S-waves speed

Light sediments: 2 3 km (1.2 1.9 mi) per second in

Earths crust:4 5 km (2.5 3.1 mi) per second

Deep mantle: 7 km (4.3 mi) per second

Seismic wave arrival

As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.

On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave

times 8

.

Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by

Beno Gutenberg

.

S-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.

Earthquake location and reporting

Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754

Flinn Engdahl regions

(F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions.

Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its

magnitude

, date and time of occurrence,

geographic coordinates

of its

epicenter

, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.

Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurements could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the

2011 Tohoku-Oki

("Fukushima") earthquake.

The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following:

Shaking and ground rupture

Damaged buildings in

Port-au-Prince

,

Haiti

, January 2010.

Shaking and

ground rupture

are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake

magnitude

, the distance from the

epicenter

, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce

wave propagation

.

The ground-shaking is measured by

ground acceleration

.

Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the

seismic

motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits.

Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as

dams

, bridges, and

nuclear power stations

and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.

Soil liquefaction

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Soil liquefaction

Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated

granular

material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the

1964 Alaska earthquake

, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.

Human impacts

Ruins of the

Għajn Ħadid Tower

, which collapsed during the

1856 Heraklion earthquake

Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and they type of population. Undeserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well developed communities.

Impacts may include:

Injuries and loss of life

Damage to critical infrastructure (short and long term)

Roads, bridges and public transportation networks

Water, power, swear and gas interruption

Communication systems

Loss of critical community services including hospitals, police and fire

General

property damage

Collapse or destabilization (potentially leading to future collapse) of buildings

With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks, depression to survivors,

and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based off the level of damage along with the socioeconomic status of the impacted community.

Landslides

Script error: The module returned a nil value. It is supposed to return an export table.

Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel are attempting rescue work.

Fires

Fires of the

1906 San Francisco earthquake

Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging

electrical power

or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the

1906 San Francisco earthquake

were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.

Tsunami

The tsunami of the

2004 Indian Ocean earthquake

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Tsunami

Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water including when an earthquake

occurs at sea

. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kiloမဳတာs (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600 800 kilometers per hour (373 497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.

Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.

Floods

Script error: The module returned a nil value. It is supposed to return an export table.

Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes, if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.

The terrain below the

Sarez Lake

in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the

landslide dam

formed by the earthquake, known as the

Usoi Dam

, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly 5 million people.

Lists of earthquakes

One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the

1556 Shaanxi earthquake

, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in

Shaanxi

, China. More than 830,000 people died.

Most houses in the area were

yaodongs

 dwellings carved out of

loess

hillsides and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The

1976 Tangshan earthquake

, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.

The

1960 Chilean earthquake

is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.

Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the

Good Friday earthquake

(27 March 1964), which was centered in

Prince William Sound

, Alaska.

The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been

megathrust earthquakes

; however, of these ten, only the

2004 Indian Ocean earthquake

is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.

Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create

tsunamis

that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes.

Prediction

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Earthquake prediction

Earthquake prediction

is a branch of the science of

seismology

concerned with the specification of the time, location, and

magnitude

of future earthquakes within stated limits.

Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by

seismologists

, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.

Forecasting

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Earthquake forecasting

While

forecasting

is usually considered to be a type of

prediction

,

earthquake forecasting

is often differentiated from

earthquake prediction

. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.

For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.

Earthquake warning systems

have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt.

Preparedness

လိက်ပရေင်ဗွဲတြး -

Earthquake preparedness

The objective of

earthquake engineering

is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings and other structures and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by

seismic retrofitting

to improve their resistance to earthquakes.

Earthquake insurance

can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes.

Emergency management

strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences.

Artificial intelligence

may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations: the Igor

expert system

is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been successfully applied to assess buildings in

Lisbon

,

Rhodes

,

Naples

.

Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing

water heaters

and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a

tsunami

caused by a large earthquake.

Historical views

An image from a 1557 book depicting an earthquake in Italy in the 4th century BCE

From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher

Anaxagoras

in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to "air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth."

Thales

of Miletus (625 547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.

Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585 526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460 371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.

Pliny the Elder

called earthquakes "underground thunderstorms".
