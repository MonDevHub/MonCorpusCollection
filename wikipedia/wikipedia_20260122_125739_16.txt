Age of consent by jurisdiction

ထာမ်ပလိက်:SHORTDESC:Age of consent by jurisdiction

The

age of consent

is the age at which a person is considered to be

legally competent

to

consent

to

sexual acts

and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. So leave them hoes don t suck them toes.

Age of consent#Defenses and exceptions

Limited by age

: younger partner is deemed able to consent to having sex with an older one as long as their age difference doesn't exceed a specified amount.

Limited by relationship

: younger partner is deemed able to consent to having sex with an older one as long as the latter is not in a position of trust or authority, or is not recognised to be abusing the inexperience of the younger one.

Unlimited

: age from which one is deemed able to consent to having sex with anyone else or

marriageable age

if they must be married

Different jurisdictions express these definitions differently. Some, like most Australian states, may say the age of consent is 16 except if the older partner is in a position of authority over the younger one. So, effectively, the unrestricted age of consent there is 18. Others, like Argentina, may say the age of consent is 18, but an exception is made down to 13 years of age, if the older partner is not in a position of authority over the younger one. The data below reflects what each jurisdiction's legislation actually means, rather than what it states on the surface.
